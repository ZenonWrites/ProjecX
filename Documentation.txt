24th September 2025:
    1. Created backend Django Project Projex.
    2. Create Project app.
    3. Creating Project models:
        Project Name & Domain: These are short pieces of text, so we'll use a CharField. This field requires a max_length argument.
        Description: This is for longer text, so a TextField is more appropriate.
        Start/Due Dates: For dates, Django has a DateTimeField.
        Status: This is a field with a limited number of options (e.g., 'To Do', 'In Progress'). We'll use a CharField with a special choices parameter to create a dropdown menu.

    4. Registered a Superuser.
    5. Registered Project model in django admin panel.
    6. Created ProjectSerializer:
       We create a class ProjectSerializer that inherits from serializers.ModelSerializer. (There is a serailizers.Serialzer for custom serializer but we will not use for now)
       A ModelSerializer is a shortcut that automatically builds a serializer based on a model.
       The inner Meta class tells the serializer which model to use (Project) and which fields to include ('__all__' means include everything).

   7. Created ProjectViewset:
       we've created a complete set of API endpoints.
       queryset: This specifies the data to be usedâ€”all objects from the Project model.
       serializer_class: This tells the viewset which serializer to use.
